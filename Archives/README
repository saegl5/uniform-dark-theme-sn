"Unzip" the bundle, then open the unzipped directory.



##### Standard Notes Desktop

Download and install Git: https://git-scm.com/downloads

Open a terminal in that directory, and populate a remote empty public GitHub repository:

$ git init
$ git remote add origin [empty GitHub repository URL]
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Initial commit"
$ git push -u origin master

Create and push a tag:

$ git tag -a [tag name] -m "[comment]"
$ git push origin [tag name]

Update the download_url address in my-extension.json:
"download_url": "[GitHub repository URL]/archive/[tag name].zip"



##### Standard Notes Mobile

Work in progress...



##### Standard Notes Web

Create another remote empty public GitHub repository, but name it [username].github.io

Upload stylesheet.css

Update the url address in my-extension.json: "url": "https://[username].github.io/stylesheet.css"



##### Subsequent Steps

Generate an author link at https://listed.to

Open either Standard Notes Desktop or Web, and import and install the author link as an extension. Include the space at the end (i.e., "= "); do not omit it.

Create a note, and paste contents from my-extension.json into it. Then, go to Actions and select Publish to Private Link.

Obtain the latest_url address, which is mentioned in my-extension.json: Go to Actions, and select Open Private Link. The address will be posted in the address bar.

Import and install the latest_url as an extension. Then, Activate the theme.

**Do NOT activate the theme in Standard Notes Mobile, though! Not yet! The theme currently crashes Standard Notes Android, and it may crash the iOS client.**

If you purchased Standard Notes Extended, then also import, install and activate the Markdown Pro editor extension. The theme will work with the Plain Editor, but it will appear much more primitive.

How to Verify Downloads

Prerequisites: gnupg (https://www.gnupg.org/)

To verify the authenticity of the ZIP files in a terminal:
$ gpg --keyserver hkps://keyserver.ubuntu.com:443 --recv-keys 0x4191f431
$ gpg --verify SHA1SUMS.gpg SHA1SUMS

To verify the integrity of the ZIP files in a terminal:
Ubuntu: $ sha1sum -c SHA1SUMS
macOS: $ shasum -a 1 -c SHA1SUMS

Windows:
$ ls *.vsix | Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA1
$ Get-Content .\SHA1SUMS
(check that hashes match)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Notes]

If one verifies authenticity and integrity using Windows Subsystem for Linux, the terminal may output "BAD signature" and "FAILED open or read."
If so, convert checksum files to Unix format, and retry.
$ sudo apt install dos2unix
$ dos2unix SHA1SUMS
$ gpg --verify SHA1SUMS.gpg SHA1SUMS
$ sha1sum -c SHA1SUMS
